     *
     * There are 5 different coordinate systems:
     *
     * - Local Space (or Object Space):
     *      This is the object's self coordinate system and it is composed by local coordinates that are
     *      relative to the object's local origin (it's center). You can think of a object's local space as if it were
     *      alone in the world with its local origin overlapping the world's origin. That way the local space coordinates
     *      would define the positions of the object's vertices relative to its origin and the sum of the object's
     *      local coordinates compose its {@link Mesh}.
     *
     * - World Space:
     *      The world space is composed by world coordinates and are the ones we are most used to, these coordinates are
     *      relative to some global origin that is the world space origin. The world comes together by transforming all
     *      of it's objects local coordinates into world coordinates, these coordinates define then the positions of all
     *      the object's mesh vertices in the world.
     *
     *      Local coordinates can be transformed to world coordinates, "placing" the object in the world space:
     *      [Local Space] -> ModelMatrix -> [World Space]
     *
     * - View Space (or Eye Space):
     *      This space is the result of transforming world coordinates to coordinates that are in front of the camera's point of view,
     *      making the origin of this space the camera's position and aligning the xyz axis to the camera orientation. The result
     *      are the coordinates of objects as seen from the camera's position and orientation.
     *
     *      World coordinates can be transformed to view space coordinates, making the objects as seen from the camera's point of view:
     *      [World Space] -> ViewMatrix -> [World Space]
     *
     * - Clip Space:
     *      This space is the result of scaling the xyz axis into a frustum shape clipping all the view space coordinates out of a given coordinate set (frustum).
     *      The projection matrix is responsible for defining that coordinate set simulating a viewing box. Each coordinate inside this frustum will end up on the screen.
     *
     *
     *      After the vertices coordinates are transformed to clip space a final operation called perspective division is performed
     *      where we divide the x, y and z components of the position vectors by the vector's homogeneous w component.
     *      Perspective division is what transforms the 4D clip space coordinates to 3D normalized device coordinates, this is
     *      what gives perspective, changing the homogenous clip space to normalised device space.
     *
     *      View space coordinates can be transformed to clip space coordinates:
     *      [View Space] -> ProjectionMatrix -> [Homogenous Clip Space]
     *      View-space to clip-space coordinates can add perspective if using perspective projection.
     *
     * - Screen Space (or Viewport Space):
     *      The resulting coordinates are finally mapped to screen coordinates (using the settings of glViewport) and turned into fragments.
     *      The viewport transformation is a scale and translation that maps the -1 to 1 normalized device-coordinate cube into window coordinates range defined by glViewport.
     *      This transformation applies not only to x and y values, but also to the z value. The viewport transformation maps normalized device-coordinate z values
     *      to the range of acceptable depth buffer values.
     *
     *      Transformation is performed in shader (i think)
